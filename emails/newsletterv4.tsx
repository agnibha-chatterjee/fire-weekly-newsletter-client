                  Amazon remains a perennial favorite among analysts, who are
                  now even more optimistic about its prospects. The excitement
                  is particularly fueled by the potential for accelerated growth
                  in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its e-commerce platform,
                  driven by advancements in AI. Despite this enthusiasm, Amazon
                  has streamlined its AWS sales team, a move that speaks to the
                  self-evident appeal of its services.
